  "The SEPARATION between the three port protocols, which is the only thing in
  `kotoba.esim.ports` that can be wrong.

  The namespace defines no behaviour, so there is nothing to test about what its
  functions return. What it does carry is a structural decision -- ADR-2607300300 D6:
  ownership transfer is a distinct protocol precisely so that *a caller holding a
  provisioning port cannot reach it*, because a transfer is the primary SIM-swap fraud
  path. That decision lives in the shape of these protocols and nowhere else.

  A later change that folded `propose-transfer` into `IProfileProvisioning` -- to save
  an argument, or because one implementation happened to want both -- would delete the
  guarantee silently: everything would still compile, every existing test would still
  pass, and every holder of a provisioning port would suddenly be able to transfer a
  subject's line. These tests exist so that change cannot be quiet.

  Modelled on kotoba-lang/card's actuation_test, which pins the same kind of
  separation between propose-only ports and post-approval actuation."
