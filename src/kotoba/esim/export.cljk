(ns kotoba.esim.export
  "Operator-facing export for eSIM profile, notification and transfer records.

  Renders to CSV and JSON for audit and downstream reporting. Pure data → text:
  no network.

  Identifiers are MASKED BY DEFAULT. EID and ICCID are device-bound quasi-PII
  (ADR-2607300300 D7), and an export is precisely where they leak: a CSV lands
  in a spreadsheet, a mail attachment, a ticket. So every function here emits
  only the last four digits unless the caller passes :reveal-identifiers? true,
  which an operator is expected to justify and record rather than set by habit.
  This is a deliberate departure from the sibling exports in kotoba-lang/rcs and
  kotoba-lang/phone, whose E.164 endpoints are not device-bound the way an EID
  is.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."

;; csv and strict json modules. Kept local to match the family's house style
